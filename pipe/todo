* count pipes 
* need processes: pipes + 1
* need as many pipes as there are pipes

per node:
* if there is infile, look for the rightmost infile, dup2(stdin)
* if there is no infile then redirect out of previous pipe to stdin
* if there is outfile, redirect stdout to rightmost outfile. empty all other outfiles
* if there is no outfile, redirect stdout to next pipe
